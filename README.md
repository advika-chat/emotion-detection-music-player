## Introduction
Facial emotion recognition is an important subfield of computer vision with practical applications in human-computer interaction, entertainment, healthcare, and more. This project detects a user's facial emotion in real time via webcam, classifies it into one of seven categories, and plays music tailored to the detected emotion.

Supported Emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

This is an end-to-end machine learning and multimedia pipeline, showcasing live emotion detection, classification, and automatic multimedia response.

## Features
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers.
- Deep CNN model trained on the FER2013 dataset for facial expression classification.
- Music recommendation and playback based on predicted emotion using Pygame.
- User-friendly web interface with Streamlit for visualization and interaction.
- Live feedback on current emotion, confidence score, and current song.
